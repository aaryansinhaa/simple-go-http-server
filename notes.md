### Notes on the Code

#### 1. **Purpose of the Code**
This code is a basic HTTP server written in Go, which:
- Serves static files from a `./static` directory.
- Handles `/hello` requests with a custom response.
- Processes form submissions sent to the `/form` endpoint.

#### 2. **Key Functionalities**
- **Static File Server**:
  - The root (`/`) path serves static files using `http.FileServer` to deliver files located in the `./static` directory.
- **Custom Handlers**:
  - `/hello`: Responds to GET requests with a basic "Hello!" message, checking for invalid paths and methods.
  - `/form`: Processes and prints form data sent via POST, extracting `name` and `address` parameters.

### Explanation of Code Components

#### 1. **Packages Used**
- **`fmt`**:
  - Provides formatted I/O functions.
  - Used here for printing messages (`fmt.Println`) and formatting responses (`fmt.Fprintf`).

- **`log`**:
  - Provides logging functions.
  - Used to handle fatal errors (e.g., if the server fails to start).

- **`net/http`**:
  - Provides HTTP client and server implementations.
  - Used for routing (`http.Handle`), serving static files (`http.FileServer`), and handling requests (`http.HandleFunc`).

#### 2. **Key Functions**
1. **`helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`**:
   - Handles requests to the `/hello` path.
   - Validates the URL path and ensures the method is `GET`.
   - Returns a "404 not found" for invalid paths or "400 Bad Request" for invalid methods.

2. **`formHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`**:
   - Processes form data sent to `/form`.
   - Uses `r.ParseForm` to parse form data.
   - Retrieves `name` and `address` fields from the form using `r.FormValue`.

3. **`main()`**:
   - Sets up the HTTP server:
     - Serves static files via `http.FileServer`.
     - Registers handlers for `/form` and `/hello` routes.
   - Starts the server on port `8080`.

### Notes on HTTP and Handlers

1. **HTTP Basics**:
   - **`w http.ResponseWriter`**:
     - Used to construct and send responses to the client.
   - **`r *http.Request`**:
     - Represents the incoming HTTP request, containing information like headers, URL, and method.

2. **Static File Server**:
   - `http.FileServer(http.Dir("./static"))` serves files from the `./static` directory. 
   - Commonly used for serving HTML, CSS, and JS files.

3. **Routing**:
   - `http.HandleFunc`: Maps URL paths to handler functions.
   - Example:
     - `/hello`: Mapped to `helloHandler`.
     - `/form`: Mapped to `formHandler`.

### Additional Concepts

1. **HTTP Status Codes**:
   - `http.StatusNotFound (404)`:
     - Used to indicate that a resource was not found.
   - `http.StatusBadRequest (400)`:
     - Indicates that the request is invalid or malformed.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - `log.Fatal`:
     - Logs the error and exits the program if the server fails to start.

3. **Form Handling**:
   - `r.ParseForm()`:
     - Parses form data from the request body.
   - `r.FormValue(key)`:
     - Retrieves the value of the form field specified by `key`.
